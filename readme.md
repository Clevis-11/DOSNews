# Open Privacy Hub

Privacy blogs are a dime a dozen. Therefore, we wanted to start something new: a privacy blog and resource run by the community. Whether you're a privacy beginner, an expert writer, researcher, or even a developer, Open Privacy Hub is your place to contribute your content and ideas to make the web a safer place.

### Post Submission Requirements

At Open Privacy Hub, we want to be pretty relaxed with our post requirements, as long as they are high quality, factual, and related to privacy or cybersecurity. You're good to go. Simply open an issue with your post, and if it meets the requirements, we'll get it published.

### Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate Marketing is strictly prohibited on Open Privacy Hub. We want this to be a place to share valuable information without influence from monetary factors.
